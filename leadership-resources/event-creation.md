# Event Creation

This guide is intended to help you create events for the Northern Virginia section of Women Who Code DC. We have many leadership resources in the [main organization repo](https://github.com/womenwhocodedc/organization/tree/master/leadership-resources), which are at varying stages of up to date, but there are some twists to event creation in NoVa.

## So You Want to Create a Meetup Event?

What are the steps that you need to take to create an event?

1. Do you have a topic? If not, [find a topic](#find-a-topic). If so, [find a host](#find-a-host).
2. Do you have a host? If not, [find a host](#find-a-host). If not, [find a topic](#find-a-topic).
3. As far as days and times go, we usually hold weeknight events either from 6:30-8:30pm or 7-9pm, and weekend professional networking brunches from 11am-1pm. Other times might work as well, but these have been historically successful for us.

### Find a Topic

Sometimes hosts will have a woman, trans, or non-binary person in their organization who's interested in giving a talk. This is a win-win for us as it works with our organizational aims as well as requiring less work from us to come up with a topic.

Otherwise there are a few tips for finding topics:

1. Revisit former talks. If it's been a while since a particular talk has been given (usually by one of the leads or directors since we have access to those), reach out to whomever gave it and see if they'd be interested in giving it again.
2. Host an algorithms night. This is probably easiest done at a library meeting room, though we might be able to find corporate hosts as well. This generally just requires picking out two algorithms on a site like leetcode.com and helping folks work through them and share their solutions.
3. Ask the wider WWCode DC community on Slack, either in a specific topic channel (like #front-end or #devops) or in #general. People might have existing talks they're willing to come out to NoVa to do, or new conference talks that they'd like a friendly first audience for. 
4. Brainstorm with other NoVa leads in our #virginia-leads channel.

Because we have a slightly smaller pool of attendees than the main DC section (though nonetheless dedicated ones) the topics that work best tend to be either broad (like contributing to open source or working on algorithms) or on current trends in tech (like DevOps).

### Find a Host

Sometimes we get hosts reaching out who directly message us or otherwise get connected to us through e-mail. In this case it's best to work with their schedules and topics they're interested in hosting. For example, sometimes if they're a Java shop they're not interested in hosting a meetup about Python.

Otherwise there are two main ways that we find hosts:

1. Though our amazing Partnerships team. Reach out to Hilliary T. or Erin F. on Slack. They're currently working on updating the hosting spreadsheet and will be happy to try and help you find space and/or expand their lists of hosts in NoVa.
2. Through the Fairfax County or Loudoun County library system. We have successfully hosted events at branches of both in the past. You need a library card in either one to reserve a meeting room but any resident of Fairfax County can get a Loudoun library card and vice versa. Organizations using space in Loudoun County libraries have to be registered in their system but thankfully we already are. If you have questions about this process, let us know on Slack.
