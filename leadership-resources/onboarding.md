# NoVa Lead Onboarding

## Steps For a Prospective Lead
* Welcome email sent to prospective lead (usually by a director)
  * Welcome, ____________! I'll start by sharing a couple of our resources with you so that you can get a sense of our structure. The [WWCDC NoVa Community](https://github.com/womenwhocodedc/nova-community) repository is where we store important public facing documents for leaders and attendees. The [WWCDC Leadership Resources](#) (TODO: Update and fill in) is a README that goes over some of the logistics of hosting a meetup and retaining attendees. [WWCDC NoVa Onboarding](https://github.com/womenwhocodedc/nova-community/blob/master/leadership-resources/onboarding.md) lists some of the steps of becoming a lead, as well as a checklist of what we need to make sure you get access to. If that all looks good to you, let me know and we'll start the ball rolling by adding you to the [#virginia_leads]() channel on our Slack group so that you can start coordinating with other leads.
* Invite prospective lead to [#virginia_leads]() on Slack to start coordination with other leads
* For the prospective lead's first few meetups, they should shadow a current lead in at least the following ways:
  * creating the event on Meetup.com
  * leading the meetup
  * greeting attendees
  * helping with any code-alongs
  * checking in with attendees after the meetup so they feel connected and involved
* Once the prospective lead is comfortable, they should occasionally take the lead on the above tasks, and they should be given access to the second set of bullet points in the **Access** section below
  * More experienced leads should encourage this as it makes newer volunteers feel that they are valued and that they're putting their free time to good use volunteering for WWCDC
  * Experienced leads can and should still take the lead sometimes, but all leads should share responsibilities at this point
